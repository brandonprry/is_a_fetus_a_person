# Is a fetus a person?

In the US, let's consider the legal implications of fetal personhood.


## Immigration
If a fetus is a person, it's not a citizen until it's born.

"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside"

By definition, that makes a fetus that is a legal person an
undocumented immigrant in the US.

### 8 U.S. Code § 1101 - Definitions

A3)  The term “alien” means any person not a citizen or national of the United States.

A fetus is neither a national nor a citizen. It is stateless until born.

A15) The term “immigrant” means every alien except an alien who is within one of the following classes of nonimmigrant aliens—

 - (i)an ambassador, public minister, or career diplomatic or consular officer who has been accredited by a foreign government, recognized de jure by the United States and who is accepted by the President or by the Secretary of State, and the members of the alien’s immediate family;
 - (ii)upon a basis of reciprocity, other officials and employees who have been accredited by a foreign government recognized de jure by the United States, who are accepted by the Secretary of State, and the members of their immediate families; and
 - (iii)upon a basis of reciprocity, attendants, servants, personal employees, and members of their immediate families, of the officials and employees who have a nonimmigrant status under (i) and (ii) above;

There are no fetal carveouts for the above definitions. 

If a fetal person is an undocumented immigrant, does that make
regulating birth regulating immigration/naturalization (converting a non-citizen into a citizen)? Do states have the authority to
regulate immigration/naturalization or is that solely in the jursidiction of Federal?

## Taxes

Can you claim a fetus as a dependent on your taxes? The IRS has very
strong opinions on what constitutes a person.

## Insurance

What if I want a life insurance policy on my fetus?

## Law Enforcement and Common Law

Is arresting a pregnant woman a violation of habeas corpus for the fetus
who has committed no crime?

In Texas, you are not allowed to get divorced if you are a pregnant
woman because the state has no jurisdiction over the fetus until it's
born.

The conservative argument against the DREAM act was that it was unconstitutional because it ascribed equal protection to non-US citizens. Why would the same argument not apply to equal protection of a fetus if a fetus is a person? Plyler set the precedent that non-citizens do have a degree of equal protection of rights, but reversing Plyler is a goal of the Republican party.

Texas and other states have argued and benefitted from arguing that undocumented immigrants have no equal protection of rights under the Constitution. Why wouldn't judicial estoppel apply when they argue a non-citizen fetus deserves equal protection? Greg Abbott has stated on record that he would shoot immigrants crossing illegally but the Biden admin would charge them with murder.

Legally, person and individual are synonymous. If you break down the word individual, it means unable to divide further. A woman is an individual, even when pregnant with a fetus. You can't divide her from her fetus without significant effort, harm, or death.  Birth is a process that creates a new individual.

It's legal to kill people in self-defense, even though self-defense is not an enumerated right.

```A castle doctrine, also known as a castle law or a defense of habitation law, is a legal doctrine that designates a person's abode or any legally occupied place (for example, an automobile or a home) as a place in which that person has protections and immunities permitting one, in certain circumstances, to use force (up to and including deadly force) to defend oneself against an intruder, free from legal prosecution for the consequences of the force used.[1] The term is most commonly used in the United States, though many other countries invoke comparable principles in their laws.```
